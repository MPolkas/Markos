        Although I think I am specializing in Tidal Disruption Events during these first steps of my science life, I am trying to keep my interests as general as possible.
        I enjoy working on both fully theoretical problems and treating carefully the data to compare with our current paradigms of certain problems. 
        That is why I select mostly apply simple laws of physics  to test theories  of astrophysics and build simple models that can be tested against observations.
        During my research, most of my effort goes into understanding supermassive black holes and galaxies. Both classes of astrophysical objects
        show a rich phenomenology and the background theoretical description of which remains oddly unknown (at least by my standards). I have already worked on astrophysical jets,
        high energy astrophysics, SED fitting (from radio to gamma-rays) of thermal and non-thermal radiation, population  inference, hydrodynamical simulations, and more.
